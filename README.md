# Gmail-Ai-Agent
Gmail-Ai-Agent is an AI powered email assistant that monitors emails. It is capable of automatically responding to emails with tailored responses, and modifying google calendar to match scheduling events. The Agent ignores automated messages, and messages that don't have an intent to meet with the user. No manual input is required other than running the script. 

The Agent is currently in test mode. Send an email to andrew@pinerypointe.net if you would like access
